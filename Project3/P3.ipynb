    "# Project 3 - Visualizing Prime Numbers\n",
    "Prime numbers - any numbers which are only divisible by 1 Since every number can be written as a unique product of prime numbers (for example, $12 = 2\\cdot2\\cdot3$), they are considered the building blocks of all natural numbers. In modern times, prime numbers play a crucial role in encryption algorithms, providing the foundation for secure data transmission and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified limit. It works by creating a list of numbers from 2 to the desired maximum and iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. First, 2 is marked as prime, and then all of its multiples are crossed out. The next unmarked number (3) is then marked as prime, and all of its multiples are crossed out, and so on. This process continues until all numbers up to the limit have been either marked as prime or crossed out as multiples of smaller primes. The remaining unmarked numbers are the primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our goal for this project - to create an animation which visualizes the process used by the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For more about this algorithm, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) (which includes a visual similar to the one we wish to create.)"

    "To start, we would like to create a modern algorithm capable of checking if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 (meaning 1 is not prime) that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Name the function `is_prime()`\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function should take an integer `n` as its lone argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function should return `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` if `n` is not prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function should loop over values greater than 1 and smaller than `n`.\n",
    "    * Do you need to check all the way to `n`?\n",

    "* If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, then `n` is not prime!\n",
    "\n",
